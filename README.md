## finalProj---Parametric-Surfaces
Final Project for Graphics 17-18 course implementing parametric surfaces

For my project, I replaced the default geometric solid functions (add_shape, generate_shape, etc; cumbersome and repetitive) with a single function called add_parametric. It takes a function on two variables *t* and *u*, outputting *x* *y* and *z* values, as a parameter and simply draws the surface generated by that function.

A few examples of this functionality include the coil, the cone, and the astonishing starburst. The included test.mdl file demonstrates these new shapes and the new technique used to generate them.

MDL Commands:

**cone** x y z r h
- x y z = center of base
- r = radius of base
- h = height

**coil** x y z r0 r1 h n
- x y z = middle of bottom
- r0 r1 = minor, major radius
- h = height
- n = number of twists

**starburst** x y z r a d
- x y z = center
- r = radius
- a = amplitude of bursts
- d = density of bursts
